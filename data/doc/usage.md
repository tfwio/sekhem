Usage
================

The first time you run `./srv-${GOARCH}`, it will generate a example configuration file, `data/conf.json`, and exit.

Running the application once more will run the server on your localhost (http://localhost:5500/) and serve a demo html file that's sitting in the `./public` directory.

You can run the server on a differt port by calling

```bash
./srv-${GOARCH} --port <number>
```

Though there are the sub-commands `run` | `go` which do the same thing, you don't need to use them as its the default context â€” to run the server.
